 * Input/Output: The program generates inputs automatically; Fibonacci is calculated in the range (1,30) inclusive
 *               Ackermann is calculated in the range (1,15) inclusive. The program generates two text files; one
 *               contains the results of the Fibonacci sequence, the other, contains results of the Ackermann Function.
 
 * Assumptions/Limitations: Both algorithms are limited to a set range of values. Neither algorithm calculates
 *                          negative numbers.
 
 * Description: This program implements optimized and un-optimized versions of the Fibonacci sequence and the
 *              Ackermann Function. The purpose is to measure logical vs. computational complexity as well as the cost
 *              (O(n)) of each algorithm.
 
 * Usage: Execute the following commands from a command terminal.
 *	 javac *.java
 *	 java fibAckDriver
