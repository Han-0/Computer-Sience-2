DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple program which simulates a river ecosystem filled with bears and fish. It features an array filled
with an unspecified number of both animals (determined by user). The program will move the animals around
the array at random based on certain conditions: Bears eat fish if they land on the same index of the
array as a fish. If an animal attempts to move to an element with another animal of the same
species; both animals will remain where they are and a new animal of that type will be created in a,
randomly selected, empty index.
