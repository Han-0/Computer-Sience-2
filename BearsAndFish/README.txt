DESCRIPTION:
This program will simulate a river ecosystem filled with bears and fish. It will feature an array filled
with an unspecified number of both animals (determined by user). The program will move the animals around
the array at random based on certain conditions: Bears eat fish if they land on the same element of the
array as the fish. If an animal attempts to move to an element with another animal of the same
species; both animals will remain where they are and a new animal of that type will be created in a,
randomly selected, empty element.
